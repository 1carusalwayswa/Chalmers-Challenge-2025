# Chalmers-Challenge-2025
A ICPC-style algorithms competition, I use very C-style code to ensure my solution ASAP, not a good example.
Just finish A - D, maybe if I have enough time I will try to solve the rest of them.
Maybe it's been too long since I participated in such a competition, I almost lost concentrantion before the game done.
Hope I have more energy next time.
